🚀 Project: HR Dashboard Analytics
📌 Detailed Description
This HR Dashboard Analytics Project is developed using Power BI to transform HR data into clear, actionable insights for strategic workforce planning and effective decision-making.

It visually represents key HR metrics, including:
1.Headcount distribution across departments, gender, and contract types
2.Turnover and retention rates
3.Salary analysis by department
4.Employee tenure and absence metrics
5.Performance scores and promotion rates
Using dynamic filters for department, manager, employee status, contract type, education level, and work location, HR teams can slice and explore data interactively to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within their workforce.
The dashboard’s clean, intuitive design ensures it can be used during HR review meetings, board discussions, and monthly HR reporting to drive discussions backed by data.
